# Signal-Windows

This is an unofficial Signal client for the Universal Windows Platform. It is (currently) a hobby project in a very early stage of production, so expect bugs and non-backwards compatible changes.

# FAQ

## What can it do right now?
- register as a master device
- be linked as a slave
- add/edit contacts
- send and receive text messages

## What can I expect next?
- proper attachment handling
- syncing groups and contacts on linking
- a prettier interface

## I want to try it out but I'm not a developer
- Send an email to signal.windows (at) gmail.com with your GitHub account name. We'll send over a beta key for the Windows Store app.
